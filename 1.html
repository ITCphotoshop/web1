  <h1>how did i study the English</h1>

  <p>
    this page is related to method of English Studying.
    how have i been studing enlgish?
    i usally study with drama that i like.
    So, if u wanna use the my method. u gotta choose the drama for your Studying.
    here is a little tips for choosing the drama.
    First, choosing the drama u like. it is leading you into the right way and go too far.
    Secoond, just hear until you cleary hear it. First time you're studying. you would not hear that cleary. but it is natural.
    so, don't worry about it.

    i've been using the moderfamilly for my drama. but i could not recommend you that drama.
    it is really difficult for first time peaple. because they in the drama are talking really fast.
    So, if you'll be in the first time studing the drama. you would choose the other thing.
